# B2B Fraud Invoice Detection using Machine Learning  

## Overview  

Fraudulent invoices pose significant risks in B2B transactions, leading to financial losses and operational inefficiencies. This project aims to develop an automated **B2B fraud detection system** using **machine learning/deep learning techniques** to identify suspicious invoices based on structured financial data.  

The primary objectives of this project are:  

- **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**  
  - Extracting meaningful features from structured invoice data.  
  - Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and outlier detection.  
  - Standardizing data for improved model performance.  

- **Machine Learning Models for Fraud Detection**  
  - Implemented models:  
    - âœ… **Decision Trees**  
    - âœ… **Random Forest**  
    - âœ… **XGBoost**  
  - Future implementations:  
    - ðŸš€ **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
    - ðŸš€ **Neural Networks (Deep Learning)**  

- **Model Evaluation & Optimization**  
  - Evaluating fraud detection performance with **precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC** metrics.  

- **Scalability & Real-world Application**  
  - Designing a system that can process large-scale B2B transaction data.  
  - Optimizing fraud detection models for high accuracy and minimal false positives.
