# Fraud-Invoice-Detection-Project

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent invoices using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop an automated system that enhances fraud detection by identifying suspicious patterns in structured financial data.

# Project Scope
Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

Extracting key features from structured invoice data.
Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and outlier detection.
Machine Learning Models for Fraud Detection

Implemented models:
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
Future implementations:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
Model Evaluation & Optimization

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and Bayesian Optimization.
Performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Technologies Used
Python (Data processing & model training)
Scikit-learn (Machine learning models & evaluation)
XGBoost (Gradient boosting for fraud detection)
Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation & preprocessing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
